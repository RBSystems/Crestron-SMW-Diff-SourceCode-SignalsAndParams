# Crestron SMW Source Code Diff'ing: Input and Output Signal Names and Parameters with Values

by Stephen Genusa, May 2017

Traditional source code diff tools are not all that helpful on Crestron SMW files. This program creates a complete diff of input and output signal names as well as parameters and values on all symbols between two different versions of the same program.

Code status: The program is roughly 80% complete. I'll be uploading once I have a functioning version 1.0 ready for release.

I adapted some SMW parsing code from Philip Lawall's [https://github.com/fueller/Crestron-Python-Graph](https://github.com/fueller/Crestron-Python-Graph "Crestron Python Graph") code.
